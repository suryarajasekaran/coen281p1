The differences between data mining and machine learning are: 1) Data mining is about applying algorithms to data, rather than using data to train a machine-learning engine. 2) Machine learning is a good approach when we have little idea of what we are looking for in the data, but has not proved successful in situations where we can describe the goals directly
