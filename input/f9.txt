RDF data model, triple or three-column format SPO - subject, predicate, object: three pieces of information are all that's needed in order to fully define a single bit of knowledge, each triple is complete and unique fact, and allow human understanding and meaning to be interpreted consistently and mechanically, each triple can be joined with other RDF triples but still retains its own unique meaning, nodes and relationships are first-class entities and each triple can stand on its own as a piece of meaningful data.
